# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions in RUST
This is me practicing Rust by solving [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## Usage
You will need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and Cargo installed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Misnad/Advent-of-Code-2024-in-Rust
cd Advent-of-Code-2024-in-Rust
cargo run 1 # To get day one solution
cargo run 2 # To get day two solution
```
The code for day `{x}` is at `src/advent{x}.rs`
and the input for day `{x}` is at `src/input{x}.txt`

## Contirbution
Code improvements are welcome (as long as they are not too complicated for a newcommer to understand).
